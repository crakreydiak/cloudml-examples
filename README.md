| [`mnist-pytorch-lit`](tutorials/1_mnist-pytorch-lit/mnist-pytorch-lit.ipynb) | Setup your Azure environment for the first time and then train a MNIST classifier using GPU-accelerated VMs. |
| [`distributed-cifar10-pytorch`](tutorials/distributed-cifar10-pytorch.ipynb) | After upgrading your quotas, you can take advantage of distributed GPU training using PyTorch. For this tutorial, we train a simple convolutional network on CIFAR10. |
