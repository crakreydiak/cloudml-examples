# Train a MNIST classifier using PyTorch Lightning

This tutorial is largely inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/tutorials/e2e-distributed-pytorch-image). It is meant both for newcomers to Azure that have no working environments or and enthusiasts will minimal experience.

You will learn:
    - How to create a workspace and a resource group using Azure CLI.
    - Manipulate your compute environment programmatically using Azure Python SDK v2.
    - Create virtual environments in Azure.
    - How to launch a basic training job using GPU-enabled VMs.
